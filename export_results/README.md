# Resources for Exporting Statistical Results

A few years ago, IPR had a Methods Workshop with several presentations on exporting results and dynamic documents.  Here are some
links to the presentation materials


* [StatTag](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/tree/main/Fall_2020/09_24_StatTag)

* Dynamic Documents

   + [R Markdown](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/tree/main/Fall_2020/09_17_RMarkdown)

   + [dyndoc](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/tree/main/Fall_2020/10_01_Stata_dyndoc)

   + [markstat](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/tree/main/Fall_2020/10_08_Stata_markstat)

       - German Rodriguez has excellent [examples](https://grodri.github.io/markstat/examples) as well

   +  I have tried to centralize everything in a [Dynamic_Documents repository](https://github.com/buckipr/Dynamic_Documents/),
   but have neglected it (still needs some work)
